# eeros-docker-bbblue
This repository provides a docker container with the latest EEROS development environment for the Beaglebone Blue installed and setup. Thus simplifying the EEROS installation process and getting you right into coding and developing.

# Prerequisites
You will need to following to use this container:

* A working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installation. Please choose the appropriate one for your host system.
* A working [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installation. Please choose the appropriate one for your host system.

Further it is recommended to use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with the following extensions:
* [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)

In the following sections it is assumed that you work with visual studio code.

# Getting started
Work through the following steps to start developing your EEROS application with this container:
* Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jonas-frei/eeros-docker-bbblue.git
```
* Open the folder with the cloned repository inside visual studio code
* Press `F1` and select `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`. Then select the current folder and wait until the container is up and running (this might take several minutes for the first time since it has to download the container).

# Test the installation
You will need a [Beaglebone Blue](https://beagleboard.org/blue) with the [latest EEROS image](https://gitlab.ost.ch/tech/inf/public/meta-ost/-/package_files/2794/download) installed to test if everything worked. You can build the included basic EEROS project by clicking on the build button in the taskbar at the bottom of the visual studio code window. Once the build finished successfully you can connect the Beaglebone Blue over USB. Make sure that the SD card with the EEROS image is inserted and that you press and hold the SD card button on the Beaglebone Blue while applying power. Once the Beaglebone Blue finished booting you can copy the executable with
```
scp build/template_project ost@192.168.7.2:/tmp
```
When prompted for the password please enter `ost`. After copying the file, you can ssh into the Beaglebone Blue with
```
ssh ost@192.168.7.2
```
The password is again `ost`. On the Beaglebone Blue you can then start the application with
```
/tmp/template_project
```
You should see an output similar to the following if everything went well
```
ost@bblue:~$ /tmp/template_project
